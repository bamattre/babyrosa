Announcing Rosa
================

A quick announcement that Rosa was born on August 7, 2020 at 9:39 AM.

Family and friends: see our [Baby
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bamacchetti/) for pictures.

Now for the numbers and context.

## Her stats

First of all, her basic statistics. These are the first questions almost
everyone has about babies - how heavy and how long? It’s helpful to put
these numbers in context by looking at how Rosa compares with other
Caucasian babies.

At **3.3 kilos (7 lbs 5 oz)** Rosa sits comfortably around the average.
If all babies were exactly the same size, we wouldn’t have a
distribution here (the “bell curve” below). We probably wouldn’t have
that many types of sports either if humans had the same body type.

I used data from [this
article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802014/) by
Janssen et al. (2017).

Length wise, though, Rosa is somewhat above the average.

## What’s in a name?

Rosa was named after her great grandmother. Her name follows the
Portuguese pronounciation, which differs mainly in the “R” - it’s
different than in English or the rolling R in Spanish. It’s tricky. See
the pronunciation of Rosa
[here](https://www.infopedia.pt/dicionarios/lingua-portuguesa/rosa) and
a breakdown of the “R” sound [here](https://youtu.be/3jdovKE2f4I?t=366).

## How common is Rosa as a name?

In the United States in 2017, around 400 Rosas were born, which is 0.02%
of all children that year.

The big question is: **What is the possibility that Rosa will be in a
class with someone with the same name?** And have to go by Rosa S. and
always get confused with another kid?

It turns out the chance Rosa will be in a class with another Rosa is
about **1 in 200**. Which is pretty unlikely.

Here I’m assuming classes are 20 kids and the popularity of names in
2020 is similar to 2017.

Unfortunately for girls named Emma, the most popular name in 2017 (and
1% of all babies), their chances are 1 in 5.

## How popular was the name Rosa over time?

Rosa is a pretty classic name, going at least back to 1880, when the
Social Security Administration started tracking baby names.

It peaked in popularity in two decades: the 1920s and 1950s. Perhaps the
influence of Rosa Luxemburg and Rosa Parks?

## What kind of names are similar?

**Given the popularity of Rosa over time, are there names with a similar
trend?** It seems Miriam is a close contender, along with Priscilla.
Jenny (as opposed to Jennifer) had a similar trend, but peaked in the
1970s. Cassidy is an example of a name that is relatively new, but like
the other names, is less popular since the 2000s.

## How the parents are doing

Inadvertently I had my smart watch on during the birth, which captured
my heart rate over time. It’s no surprise it went up after we saw the
baby for the first time.

My watch also tracks sleep, which gives a pretty accurate portrayal of
pre and post-partum sleep habits (okay, on the dad's side). However, the 
watch can only record sleep that is longer than 3 hours per stint - 
the 9th and 10th were pretty tough.

and trends out there for you to explore.
